Terrain Title: The Grass is Greener on the Other Side

On one side of the divide, the terrain is very rough. The soil is terrible, the ground is very bumpy, and there is barely any plantation except
for a few palm trees and some grass.

On the other side, the soil is very fertile, there are tons of trees, grass, and plain fields. Ideally this is the side where farmers wish to
be on so they can grow crops. 

Unfortunately, those on the rough side are unable to cross because there is no way of getting across the divide. The only way they can get 
across to is forge rafts out of the few palm trees that exist.
